## Development Roadmap

The plan for this aircraft is to create at least three SF-25 Falke variants:

  - A monowheel SF-25B, D-KOSI with a 65HP, 1.7L Limbach engine
  - A monowheel SF-25C, HA-1275 with an 85HP, 2.0L Limbach engine
  - A taildragger Rotax Falke, G-FLKS with a 100HP Rotax 912S engine

Optionally some variations wih different landing gear or cockpit conifgurations may be added.
